# Bachelors Thesis: Stochastic Differential Equations in Finance

## üìò Project Overview

This repository contains the work of my Bachelor's thesis, which explores the use of **stochastic differential equations (SDEs)** in **financial mathematics**. The central focus of this study is the derivation and application of the **Black-Scholes formula** for option pricing, along with its theoretical foundations and practical implementation.

## üßÆ Methodology

1. **Mathematical Foundation**:  
   Developed a rigorous understanding of stochastic processes and It√¥ calculus to model asset price dynamics as **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**.

2. **Black-Scholes Derivation**:  
   Derived the **Black-Scholes Partial Differential Equation (PDE)** for European call and put options.

3. **Analytical Solution**:  
   Transformed the Black-Scholes PDE into the **heat equation** and solved it using the **Fourier transform**.

4. **Empirical Application**:  
   Used real market data from **Yahoo Finance** to price options and compare theoretical vs. actual outcomes.

## üìä Real-World Case Study

A case study was conducted using historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance to validate the Black-Scholes model. Results were analyzed to evaluate the model's performance in real-world financial markets.

## üöß Ongoing Work

Currently, I am extending this work using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to translate and enhance the original thesis. The goal is to experiment with **learning-based agents** that optimize option pricing strategies using market data and stochastic models.
