# 📓 Notes (English Deductions)

This folder contains **English-language notes and deductions** from my original Bachelor's thesis written in Spanish. The goal is to progressively translate and rework the main mathematical derivations and ideas into well-structured, LaTeX-formatted PDF documents for broader accessibility and clarity.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- Translate key theoretical concepts and results from my thesis into English
- Provide standalone documents explaining specific topics (e.g., Itô calculus, Black-Scholes derivation)
- Lay the foundation for future research and reinforcement learning applications

---

## 📄 Available Notes

Each note is compiled as a LaTeX document and exported to PDF.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `black-scholes-derivation.pdf` | Step-by-step derivation of the Black-Scholes equation |
| `ito-integral.pdf` | Definition and properties of the Itô integral |
| *(More coming soon)* | More topics from the thesis will be added as translation progresses |

## 🛠️ How to Compile LaTeX

If you'd like to compile the `.tex` files yourself:

```bash
pdflatex black-scholes-derivation.tex
